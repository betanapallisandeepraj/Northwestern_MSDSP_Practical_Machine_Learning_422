    "Pandas is probably the most widely used packages in python, especially for data analytics. It provides fast, flexible, and is designed to make working with relational/labeled data easy and intuitive. There are two types of data structures in pandas, a series (1-dimensional, think a single column) & dataFrame (2-dimensional, think tabular data). There's a ton that pandas can do, all of which we won't have the time to go over, but here is a link to some highlights:\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, pandas is the data structure of choice when working with other packages in the data science and advanced analytics enviromnent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is not only great at wrangling/munging and other handling of data, but it's also highly optimized to do calculations and other statitical operations. This is because pandas is built on NumPy, which is the numerical package for Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a high level view of pandas, let's get started on using it."

User defined functions come in handy when you create code that will be repeatable. It would become very tedious to keep writing the same code over and over again to produce the same results. Some relevant use cases include cleaning a file on a regular basis, performing calculations, or automating a process.\n",
